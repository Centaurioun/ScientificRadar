<h2>&nbsp;TL;DR:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A wild <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_orangutan" target="_blank">Sumatran orangutan</a> treated his facial wound with the leaves of a plant known for its medicinal properties.</li>
<li>This behavior is the first documented instance of a non-human using a plant known for its medicinal properties for active wound treatment.</li>
<li>The plant used, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibraurea_tinctoria" target="_blank">Fibraurea tinctoria</a></em>, is recognized in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_medicine" target="_blank">traditional medicine</a> for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analgesic" target="_blank">analgesic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory" target="_blank">anti-inflammatory</a>, anti-bactertial, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-fungal" target="_blank">anti-fungal</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant" target="_blank">anti-oxidant</a> properties.</li>
<li>The orangutan's actions suggest a potential understanding of natural remedies, hinting at complex cognitive abilities shared with humans.</li>
<li>This discovery provides insights into the origins of medicinal practices and the potential of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-medication" target="_blank">self-medication</a> in animals.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a groundbreaking discovery, researchers have documented the first known case of a wild animal actively treating its own wound with a plant species known to contain biologically active medicinal compounds. The study, published in <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58988-7" target="_blank">Scientific Reports</a></strong>, observed a male <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_orangutan" target="_blank">Sumatran orangutan</a> (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_orangutan" target="_blank">Pongo abelii</a></em>) who sustained a facial injury engaging in what appears to be a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-medication" target="_blank">self-medication</a>.</p>
<h2>The Discovery of Rakus and His Self-Medicating Behavior</h2>

<hr />
<p>In 2009, researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior began studying a group of Sumatran orangutans in Indonesia's Gunung Leuser National Park. One notable member of this group was Rakus, a young male who, at the time, had not yet developed the distinctive cheek pads known as flanges that signify maturity in males. Over the years, Rakus transformed into a dominant male with fully developed flanges.</p>
<h2>The Incident and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-medication" target="_blank">self-medication</a></h2>
<p>In June 2022, Rakus sustained a significant facial wound following a violent encounter, likely with another male orangutan. Researchers observed him selecting, chewing, and applying the leaves and stems of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allamanda" target="_blank">Akar Kuning</a> plant (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibraurea_tinctoria" target="_blank">Fibraurea tinctoria</a></em>) to his wound. This plant is known locally for its medicinal properties against diabetes, dysentery, and malaria.</p>

<p>Wound healing process: On June 25, Rakus was observed consuming and then applying the chewed leaves of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibraurea_tinctoria" target="_blank">Fibraurea tinctoria</a></em> to his facial wound. The following day, he continued to feed on the leaves of the same plant. By June 30, the wound had closed, and by August 25, it had become barely noticeable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Over the course of eight days, Rakus repeatedly treated his injury with the plant. Observers noted a rapid healing process, with the wound fully closed within just over a week.</p>

<hr />
<h2>&nbsp;Implications of Rakus's Behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shared Knowledge: Rakus's behavior suggests a shared knowledge or parallel discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicinal_plants" target="_blank">medicinal plants</a> between humans and orangutans, who coexist in the same ecosystems.</li>
<li>Animal Intelligence and Culture: The incident highlights animal intelligence and the potential for cultural behaviors in non-human species, where knowledge may be passed down through generations.</li>
<li>Implications for Human Medicine: Understanding these behaviors can enrich human medicine, offering insights into natural remedies that have been tested by nature itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Broader Context of Animal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-medication" target="_blank">self-medication</a></h2>
<p>Rakus is not alone in the animal kingdom when it comes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-medication" target="_blank">self-medication</a>. Studies have shown various species using natural resources to manage parasites or treat ailments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canadian snow geese (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_goose" target="_blank">Anser caerulescens</a></em>) ingest certain leaves to expel tapeworms.</li>
<li>Dusky-footed wood rats (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusky-footed_woodrat" target="_blank">Neotoma fuscipes</a></em>) use aromatic plants in their nests to deter parasites.</li>
<li>Chimpanzees in Gabon (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee" target="_blank">Pan troglodytes</a></em>) apply insects to wounds, possibly to promote healing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implications for Human Medicine</h2>
<p>This revelation about Rakus and the broader practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoopharmacognosy" target="_blank">zoopharmacognosy</a>&mdash;animals using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicinal_plants" target="_blank">medicinal plants</a>&mdash;suggests that observing wildlife can provide valuable lessons. Perhaps our ancestors learned some of their medicinal practices by observing animals, a practice that could be revitalized today as we search for new, natural healing agents.</p>
<p>The story of Rakus and his use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allamanda" target="_blank">Akar Kuning</a> plant to treat his wounds offers a fascinating glimpse into the natural world's pharmacy. By studying and learning from the behavior of animals like Rakus, we may unlock new insights into natural remedies that could benefit both animal and human health. As we continue to explore the complex relationships between animals, plants, and their environments, we may discover new ways to live healthier, more integrated lives with nature.</p>
