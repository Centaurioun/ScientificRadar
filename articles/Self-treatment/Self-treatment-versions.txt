Title: Orangutan Pioneers Use of Medicinal Plant to Treat Wound

TL;DR:

A wild Sumatran orangutan was observed using a plant with medicinal properties to treat an open wound
This is the first scientific record of a wild animal self-medicating with a plant known to have healing qualities
The orangutan, named Rakus, ate the leaves of the plant and applied a poultice of chewed leaves to the wound
Within 8 days of treatment, Rakus' wound had fully healed
The findings suggest orangutans and humans share medicinal plant knowledge from inhabiting the same environments
In a stunning display of self-care, a wild Sumatran orangutan named Rakus was observed treating an open wound on his face using the leaves of a medicinal plant known as akar kuning (Fibraurea tinctoria) . This marks the first scientific documentation of a wild animal using a plant with known healing properties to self-medicate .

The remarkable event, published in Scientific Reports, was witnessed by a team of primatologists led by Caroline Schuppli from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior . In June 2022, Rakus was seen with an open gash on his cheek, likely sustained during a fight with another male .

Days later, Rakus began consuming the leaves and stems of akar kuning, a plant rarely eaten by orangutans but used by local people to treat various ailments . In a seven-minute medicating session, Rakus chewed the leaves into a poultice and applied it to his wound, even spreading additional leaf mash on the injury when flies landed on it .

Remarkably, just eight days after beginning treatment, Rakus' wound had completely closed . Schuppli's team, despite 21 years observing orangutans in the area, had never seen another individual use akar kuning for self-medication .

According to animal self-medication expert Michael Huffman, this study provides the first scientific evidence of an animal using a medicinal plant to consistently treat a wound over time . He notes that many species, from geese to chimpanzees, exhibit self-medicating behaviors and that early humans likely discovered some remedies by observing animals .

The findings suggest that orangutans and humans, inhabiting the same environments, share knowledge about the healing properties of plants. "It shows that orangutans and humans share knowledge," Schuppli remarks. "Since they live in the same habitat, I would say that's quite obvious, but still intriguing to realize" .

Rakus' inspiring act of self-care opens a captivating window into the world of animal cognition and the potential for knowledge sharing across species boundaries. As we continue to explore the depths of the natural world, stories like this remind us of the awe-inspiring intelligence and resilience of our fellow creatures.

Title: Wild Orangutan Applies Medicinal Plant to Treat Facial Wound in Groundbreaking Discovery

Meta Description: Scientists observed a wild Sumatran orangutan actively treating his own facial wound by applying leaves from a medicinal plant known for its healing properties.

TL;DR:

A male Sumatran orangutan sustained a facial wound
Three days later, he selectively picked leaves from the liana plant Fibraurea tinctoria (Akar Kuning)
He chewed the leaves into a juice and repeatedly applied it to his facial wound
He then fully covered the wound with the chewed leaves
F. tinctoria contains compounds with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial properties useful for wound healing
In a groundbreaking discovery, researchers have documented the first known case of a wild animal actively treating its own wound with a plant species known to contain biologically active medicinal compounds. The study, published in Scientific Reports , observed a male Sumatran orangutan who sustained a facial injury engaging in what appears to be a form of self-medication.

Three days after incurring the wound, the orangutan named Rakus was spotted selectively ripping off leaves from a liana vine called Akar Kuning (Fibraurea tinctoria). He proceeded to chew the leaves, creating a plant juice that he repeatedly applied directly onto his facial wound. As a final step, Rakus fully covered the treated area with the chewed leaves.

The remarkable behavior caught scientists' attention because F. tinctoria, found in Southeast Asian tropical forests, has long been used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases like dysentery, diabetes and malaria . Previous chemical analyses revealed the presence of compounds like furanoditerpenoids and protoberberine alkaloids, which exhibit antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and other properties highly relevant for wound healing .

"This possibly innovative behavior presents the first systematically documented case of active wound treatment with a plant species known to contain biologically active substances by a wild animal," the researchers stated . "It provides new insights into the origins of human wound care practices."

While self-medication through ingesting plants has been widely observed across animal species , examples of topical application to treat injuries or illness are exceedingly rare. The most well-documented cases involve chimpanzees catching insects and applying them to their own wounds or those of other chimps, potentially to serve an antiseptic function .

Among orangutans, there have been multiple reports of the apes consuming plants used in traditional medicine, like ginger for inflammation . A separate study found orangutans topically applying a lather from the medicinal Dracaena cantleyi plant, which has anti-inflammatory effects .

However, Rakus's deliberate use of F. tinctoria represents the first clear example of an animal exploiting a plant's pharmacological properties to actively treat a wound on its own body. The scientists posit that further research is needed to understand if the orangutan treatment was purely by chance or exhibited an intentional understanding of the plant's medicinal value .

Regardless, the finding offers a fascinating glimpse into the potential origins of human medicinal practices and intelligence exhibited by our evolutionary cousins. As lead author Isabelle Laumer noted, "This observation really highlights the level of complexity in orangutan's plant knowledge and provides a new perspective on ethnomedicine and therapeutic behavior in wildlife."
