<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_editing" target="_blank">prime editing</a></strong></p>
<dl>
<dd> A revolutionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing" target="_blank">gene editing</a> technique that combines the precision of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing" target="_blank">CRISPR-Cas9</a> with the efficiency of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcriptase" target="_blank">reverse transcriptase</a> to directly write new genetic information into a specific DNA site. Unlike traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing" target="_blank">CRISPR-Cas9</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_editing" target="_blank">prime editing</a> does not rely on double-stranded DNA breaks, reducing the risk of unwanted mutations and increasing its potential for therapeutic use.</dd>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage-assisted_continuous_evolution" target="_blank">phage-assisted continuous evolution</a> (PACE) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_engineering" target="_blank">protein engineering</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage-assisted_continuous_evolution" target="_blank">phage-assisted continuous evolution</a> is a powerful technique that allows for the rapid evolution of proteins with desired properties. By combining PACE with rational <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_engineering" target="_blank">protein engineering</a>, researchers can transcend the limitations of wild-type enzymes and generate highly efficient, compact prime editors. In the case of Doman et al.'s study, PACE was employed to improve the editing efficiencies of compact RTs by up to 22-fold, resulting in the development of prime editors that are significantly more efficient and compact than their predecessors.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage-assisted_continuous_evolution" target="_blank">phage-assisted continuous evolution</a> (PACE)</strong></p>
<dl>
<dd> A method of evolving proteins or nucleic acids at an accelerated pace by linking their function to the propagation of bacteriophages. This technique allows for the rapid discovery of genetic variants with desirable properties, such as increased efficiency or specificity, by simulating a high-pressure evolutionary environment.</dd>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Evolution of Compact Reverse Transcriptases (RTs)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reverse transcriptases play a crucial role in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_editing" target="_blank">prime editing</a> process, as they are responsible for converting the RNA template into DNA. In their quest to enhance the efficiency of prime editors, Doman et al. surveyed 59 enzymes from 14 different classes of RTs. While they found that diverse RTs can support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_editing" target="_blank">prime editing</a>, the wild-type forms of these enzymes do not mediate efficient editing in mammalian cells. Even the most active dual-AAV-compatible compact RTs showed lower editing efficiency compared to the full-length RT in PE2 when installing long, complex edits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To address these challenges, the team leveraged the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_engineering" target="_blank">protein engineering</a> and PACE. They discovered that different reverse transcriptases specialize in different types of edits and used this insight to create RTs that outperform both PEmax and PEmax &Delta;RNaseH, the truncated editor commonly used in dual-AAV delivery systems for in vivo applications. This breakthrough led to the development of the PE6 series of prime editors, which offer significant improvements in editing efficiency and compactness.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The PE6 Series: A Leap Forward in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_editing" target="_blank">prime editing</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PE6 series of prime editors represents a major advancement in genome editing technology. These highly efficient, compact prime editors have been shown to enhance therapeutically relevant editing in patient-derived fibroblasts and primary human T cells. Moreover, PE6 variants enable the installation of longer insertions in vivo following dual-AAV delivery. In a remarkable feat, they achieved 40% loxP sequence insertion in the cortex of mouse brains - a 24-fold improvement over previous cutting-edge prime editors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PE6 series has shown remarkable success in editing complex genomic sites and holds great potential for therapeutic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing" target="_blank">gene editing</a>, with applications demonstrated in correcting mutations associated with diseases like Tay-Sachs.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The implications of these advancements are profound, especially in the context of therapeutic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing" target="_blank">gene editing</a>. The compact size of the newly developed prime editors makes them suitable for delivery via AAVs, overcoming one of the major hurdles in gene therapy. Moreover, their enhanced efficiency and specificity in editing complex genetic sites open new avenues for treating a wide range of genetic disorders with unprecedented precision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most significant challenges in gene therapy has been the delivery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing" target="_blank">gene editing</a> tools into the target cells efficiently and safely. The development of compact prime editors, as reported by Doman et al., addresses this challenge head-on. By reducing the size of these editors, they become compatible with AAV delivery methods, which are known for their safety and efficiency in delivering genetic material to cells. This breakthrough not only expands the potential applications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing" target="_blank">gene editing</a> therapies but also enhances their feasibility and accessibility.</p>
